## Technology
**Data Cleaning and Analysis:** Python version 3.7.6 (Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook) with Python Libraries used to clean data and perform exploratory analysis (Pandas, numpy, flask, SQLAlchemy)

**Database Storage:** SQL (Postgres & pgAdmin, AWS) is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

**Machine Learning:** SciKitLearn is the Machine Learning library we'll be using to create a Random Forest classifier. 

**Dashboard:** In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. To host the web page, we will use HTML and CSS with embedded Tableau visualizations.
