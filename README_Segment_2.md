# Capstone Project - Sociodemographic Data and COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in the US

## Team
* **Square:** Machine learning models (Tiffany)
* **Circle:** Refine analysis; presentation and dashboard (Aarani)
* **Triangle:** Refine and connect the database (Amy)
* **X:** Dashboard (Hayden)

## Communication Protocols
* Group Slack channel created for quick and easy communications among all team members,
* Google document created for information sharing (ideas, data, roles),
* Additional zoom meeting time(s) determined outside of class hours (Saturdays and Sundays), and
* Next steps will be determined at the end of each class and/or meeting.

## Project Overview
**Topic:** An analysis of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

**Topic selection rationale:** Given the global presence of COVID-19 and the implementation of recent months of vaccine rollout have been a positive change in Ontario, our team decided to look into vaccine hesitancy to understand this issue better.

**Data Description/Source:** Our team was able to secure a dataset from Kaggle that captures United States county-level data that includes sociodemographic data, geographic data and percentage of populations that are vaccine hesitant. The original dataset has 18 columns of sociodemographic and geographic indicators, and two columns for vaccine hesitancy outcomes. The dataset contains information from 3,142 counties in the United States. The data was obtained through Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/deepshah16/vaccine-hesitancy-for-covid19), and is sourced from https://www.data.gov.

**Questions:**
1. Based on the sociodemographic indicators available, are we able to predict vaccine hesitancy in US counties?
2. How do sociodemographic indicators affect vaccine hesitancy?
3. What barriers exist in vaccine implementation and how can these be mitigated?
4. How can this analysis inform vaccine implementation strategies within an Ontario context?

## Technology
**Data Cleaning and Analysis:** Python version 3.7.6 (Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook) with Python Libraries used to clean data and perform exploratory analysis (Pandas, numpy, flask, SQLAlchemy)

**Database Storage:** SQL (Postgres & pgAdmin, AWS) is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

**Machine Learning:** SciKitLearn is the Machine Learning library we'll be using to create a Random Forest classifier. 

**Dashboard:** In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. To host the web page, we will use HTML and CSS with embedded Tableau visualizations.

## Dashboard
We are using the Tableau to creating the powerful analytic dashboards for our vacine hesitancy analysis project, Tableau is popular to handle big dataset and create interactive visuallization, also its easy for non-technical audience to understand the data story. 

In the dashboards, there are interactive elements for states, category of SVI, level of vacine concern to make the chart can be filtered or selected and shows the related table, chart and heat mao data. That help display the data findings for audience.
