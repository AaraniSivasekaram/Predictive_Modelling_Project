### Project Overview

### Technology
* **Data Cleaning and Analysis**
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.
* **Database Storage**
SQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.
* **Machine Learning**
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier.
* **Dashboard**
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.
